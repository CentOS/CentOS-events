  end: 2014-02-01 15:50 CET
  description: |-
    In recent years GDB has undergone a renaissance, adding Python scripting
    and other cool new features. This talk will show you how to customize
    GDB for your application and your debugging needs. We'll go into depth
    about pretty printing, stack trace filtering, and writing new commands;
    and will also discuss writing GUIs and other tools inside GDB. Finally,
    we'll cover other interesting and useful GDB projects.

- title: 'Entangle: Tethered Camera Control & Capture'
  speaker: Daniel Berrange
  start: 2014-02-01 14:20 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 14:35 CET
  description: |-
    Entangle is an open source project that provides a Linux desktop
    application for “tethered shooting”. It uses the ligphoto2 library to
    trigger the camera shutter, preview shots via the camera's "live view"
    capability, download captured images and access all the live camera
    settings. It is useful for a variety of use cases including studio model
    shoots, macro still life, stop motion animation shoots,
    astro-photography and more.

    The talk will be targeted at Linux users & developers who are
    photographers interested in any of the aforementioned use cases.

    This session will cover the current status of integration between oVirt
    and the OpenStack image repository (Glance), analyzing the motivations,
    the low level implementation (including Keystone authentication) and the
    ideas for the future. The presentation will include also an ample part
    dedicated to the future work and ideas to introduce the integration with
    Cinder (the OpenStack volume manager).

- title: New Developments and Advanced Features in the Libvirt Management API
  speaker: Daniel Berrange
  start: 2014-02-01 14:20 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 15:00 CET
  description: |-
    In the 8+ years since it was founded, the libvirt project grown to
    become the leading open source API for the management of virtualization
    hosts, with a strong focus on supporting the open source virtualization
    & container technologies, KVM, QEMU, Xen and LXC. Many people working in
    the open source virtualization management space already have an
    understanding of the core features and architecture of libvirt. This
    talk will thus focus on a selection of recently developed features and
    of some of the other important, but less well known, features of
    libvirt.

    The talk will be targeted at virtualization application developers using
    libvirt, with a bias towards those using KVM or LXC. At the end of the
    talk the audience will better understand how to take advantage of
    libvirt for their development needs.

  description: |-
    For several years now, the oVirt project is leveraging KVM and relevant
    technologies (ksm, etc) in data center virtualizations. Being a mature
    and feature reach, oVirt takes another step forward with introducing a
    Pluggable Scheduling API. This presentation will review recent oVirt
    improvements in the areas of VM scheduling. The first part will discuss
    about the architecture of the new scheduler. On the second part we will
    show samples of VM scheduling plug-ins, and integrate it to a live
    setup.

    Red Hat's project of porting OpenJDK to run on ARM's new 64-bit
    architecture began about 18 months ago. This talk will describe the work
    we have performed over the last year, explaining how we went about
    implementing the client and server JIT compilers. In particular, we will
    give details and examples of how we have tuned the server compiler to
    generate code that has been optimized to make use of the AArch64
    instruction set.

- title: Shenandoah - an ultra-low pause-time GC for OpenJDK
  speaker: Roman Kennke
  start: 2014-02-01 00:00 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 12:25 CET
  description: |-
    Current garbage collectors for OpenJDK all need to stop the application
    periodically to perform garbage collection tasks. This is a scalability
    bottleneck because those pause times are dependend on heap size.
    Shenandoah is a new garbage collector for OpenJDK, currently developed
    by Red Hat, that aims to reduce GC pause times to a minimum by
    implementing marking and object evacuation to run concurrently with
    application threads, and utilizing parallel garbage collection threads.

    common shared storage back-end for the whole thing, and what value
    OpenShift adds into the mix. A full open source cloud on commodity

- title: 'Valgrind Support in the Eclipse IDE: An Overview of the Eclipse Valgrind
    plugin provided by the Linux Tools Project'
  speaker: Roland Grunberg
  start: 2014-02-02 10:00 CET
  end: 2014-02-02 10:25 CET
  description: |-
    For developers it can often be a bit of a learning curve to learn the
    proper use of a new tool. For certain development tools the entry
    barrier can be quite high and can often discourage users. The Linux
    Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++ development on the
    Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools, such as Valgrind.

    This talk is aimed at people of varying experience with the Valgrind
    tool who have never used it within the Eclipse IDE.

  description: |-
    Valgrind is a tool that can be used for testing but also needs to be
    tested itself as any other piece of software. This talk will focus on
    testing done before releasing new Valgrind RPM in Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux.

    GDB projects of interest to Valgrind developers looking at GDB/Valgrind
    integration, including the current state of GDBserver in GDB, where we
    are on local vs remote feature parity, all-stop vs non-stop modes,
    multi-process and multi-target projects, reverse debugging and possibly
    others.
