    Fossetcon is not a GNU/Linux conference, nor is it a *BSD conference. 
    Fossetcon can be more described as a *nix(Unix like) conference that focuses
    primarily on Free and Open Source Software and the systems that run it -
    whether it be hardware or software. We are calling all FOSS, FLOSS, and OSS
    Developers, Students, Teachers, Systems Administrators, Hardware Hackers,
    Enthusiasts, Newbies and Trolls(trolls need love too) to come out and
    participate in Fossetcon 2014 in Orlando, FL.
