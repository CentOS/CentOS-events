  Collocated with [Fossetcon](http://fossetcon.org/2014/), This is a day-long event with a strong technical focus, using CentOS as a platform for all things Docker. 

  The morning session will feature talks from members of the community, as well as CentOS Board members. The afternoon session will be broken down as a hackathon focusing on building your own custom Docker images, deploying Docker, and running your own docker index.
