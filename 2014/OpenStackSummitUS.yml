- title: Extending TripleO for OpenStack Infrastructure Management
  speaker: Keith Basil
  start: 2014-05-14 11:00
  end: 2014-05-14 11:40
  description: |
    Operational awareness and value for cloud operators has largely been
    ignored by the OpenStack community. Today with the maturity of
    TripleO and inclusion of Tuskar, we can now begin to think about
    TripleO's use as a vehicle for OpenStack infrastructure management.

    The question now is How do we extend TripleO with additional
    value?".

    Within this context, there are several areas of integration which
    can be explored. These include an operator dashboard, infrastructure
    instrumentation agents, bare metal drivers and other supporting
    services. Hardware and software vendors can gain insight into what
    integration looks like from a product point of view.

    In this session, we will explore:
    - Why TripleO works for infrastructure management
    - TripleO management integration points
    - What TripleO means for hardware/software vendors
    - Early work in this area

- title: Introduction to OpenStack Orchestration
  speaker: Zane Bitter and Steven Hardy
  start: 2014-05-12 11:15
  end: 2014-05-12 11:55
  description: |
    In this session you will learn how the Orchestration capabilities of
    OpenStack, provided by the Heat project, can help make the
    deployment and management of your cloud workloads simpler and more
    robust by allowing you to represent infrastructure as code.
    If you have requirements related to orchestrating applications on
    OpenStack clouds, this session will help you understand what Heat
    is, an overview of how to use it, key terminology, template language
    concepts, and details of the current and planned features.
    Included in this session will be information about the new HOT DSL,
    providers/environments abstractions, and latest
    software-configuration capabilities for Icehouse. Finally you will
    see a demo of Heat in action!
    (Speaker Info - Steven Hardy and Zane Bitter are both core
    developers on the Heat project, and have been active contributors
    since the project was started)

- title: The state of OpenStack Data Processing: Savanna, now and in Juno
  speaker: Matthew Farrellee, Sergey Lukjanov, and John Speidel
  start: 2014-05-12 14:00
  end: 2014-05-12 14:40
  description: |
    The Savanna project, currently in incubation under the OpenStack
    Data Processing program, provides users an ability to provision and
    manage Hadoop clusters on OpenStack, and has seen a great deal of
    progress, development, and changes during the Icehouse development
    cycle. The focus of the project is on two primary use cases:
    on-demand cluster provisioning and on-demand Hadoop task execution
    (Elastic Data Processing).
    In this talk, we will provide an overview of project Savanna, its
    main goals and focus, and a tour of new features introduced in the
    Icehouse cycle. These features include: integration with Heat, basic
    API tests in Tempest, enabled asynchronous gate, and bunch of new
    Elastic Data Processing (EDP) features. We’ll also discuss new
    Hortonworks Data Platform plugin features, data-locality support,
    and the ability to use Savanna through the command line. Finally, we
    will discuss the roadmap for the Juno release.
    After attending this session, you will have a good understanding for
    where Savanna is now and where it’s going, particularly with regard
    to the Unified Agent approach, on which we’re currently working on
    leveraging in Savanna.

- title: Divide and Conquer: Resource Segregation in the OpenStack Cloud
  speaker: Stephen Gordon
  start: 2014-05-12 14:50
  end: 2014-05-12 15:30
  description: |
    As a cloud deployment grows both in size and in variety of workloads
    it is useful to be able to segregate compute resources based on
    factors such as physical location, networking connections, or the
    availability of specialized hardware. OpenStack provides a number of
    options for segregating compute resources in the cloud including:
    - Cells,
    - Host Aggregates,
    - Regions, and
    - Availability Zones.
    The differences between each of these approaches are nuanced and
    often misunderstood. Additionally the capabilities available when
    using some of these techniques, particularly Host Aggregates and
    Cells, have been expanded in recent OpenStack releases.
    This session will provide an indepth look into these each of these
    options for segregating resources in the OpenStack cloud including
    their pros and cons, example use cases, and performance
    considerations.

- title: Implementation and Lessons learned from building a large scale cloud (Massachusetts Open Cloud/MOC)

  description: |
    The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) will be a public cloud based on a
    new model that allows many companies and institutions to participate
    in its implementation and operation. MOC is bringing multiple
    vendors together within a single infrastructure, hence fostering
    collaboration and interoperability amongst them. Several industry
    partners have joined the effort and been instrumental in the initial
    implementation of MOC. 
    The goal for MOC is to foster interoperability and innovation
    amongst insterested parties and the opportunity to explore new
    computing models.
    This session will provide an overview of the architecture and it's
    evolution
    - Blueprint to build a multi-vendor cloud infrastrucutre
        - Architecture decisions and guidance
        - Considerations for scale, operations and upgrades
    - Lessons learned from the initial deployment to operations will be covered 
        - Automation of deployments and extending the infrastructure
        - Orchestration of workloads based on SLAs and QoS requirements
        - Operational aspects and tools
        - Best practices and architecture decisions are shared and key technology areas highlighted (Neutron, Cinder, Deployment, Operations, Upgrades etc)

    We will also cover use cases for applications deployed on the MOC
    cloud, ranging from Big Data analytics, PaaS and others
    With the participation of several key Boston universities such as
    Harvard, Boston University, MIT and North Eastern, UMass and other
    parthers MOC will evolve into a large scale open cloud
    infrastructure

    The Savanna project, currently in incubation under the OpenStack
    Data Processing program, provides users an ability to provision and
    manage Hadoop clusters on OpenStack, and has seen a great deal of
    progress, development, and changes during the Icehouse development

    execution and collection of job results.

- title: OpenStack :: Where Continuous Delivery and Distros Collide
  speaker: Mark McLoughlin and Monty Taylor
  start: 2014-05-14 16:30
  end: 2014-05-14 17:10
  description: |
    Like many open-source projects, OpenStack uses a time-based release
    model. Feature development happens in a flurry of activity in the
    first part of each release cycle and then we taper, allowing enough
    time for many eyes to make shallow bugs" and for us to gain enough
    confidence in the quality of our release candidates. Even after a
    release, we continue to maintain a stable branch for issues found
    and fixed post-release.

    Linux distros apply a similar model when they bring together the
    releases of many open-source projects into a coherent, usable and
    stable product. OpenStack's predictable release schedule, the
    tapering, the stabilization and the post-release maintenance are all
    essential to the needs of distros and, in turn, the users of those
    distros.

    Unusually, OpenStack also explicitly caters to another type of users -
    what we call "trunk chasers". Public cloud providers like HP and
    Rackspace invest significantly in a continuous delivery pipeline
    so that they can keep pace with OpenStack development, deploy
    regularly, give timely feedback upstream and minimize the risk
    associated with each incremental update. In these days of agile
    development, DevOps and continuous delivery, the benefits of such
    a model are now clear.

    As such, OpenStack is an important case study for how recent
    thinking around continuous delivery is influencing open-source
    projects. Many questions remain unanswered, however. Are we going
    to continue to see projects like OpenStack see themselves as
    catering to two radically different audiences, or is this the
    beginning of fundamental shift in open-source?

    Mark and Monty - Openstack Technical Committee and Foundation
    Board members, prominent OpenStack contributors and senior
    engineering leaders at Red Hat and HP - have had the opportunity
    to look at this dilemma from several different angles. In the
    talk, they will delve into some of the details behind how
    OpenStack caters to both models. They will examine the mindset and
    needs of each audience. They will talk about topics such as CI,
    upgrades, deployment tools, reference architectures, community
    management, feature development, user feedback and more.

    Attendees can hope to learn some more about OpenStack and some of
    the challenges in running an open-source project, building a
    distro or maintaining a public cloud. Beyond OpenStack, however,
    the talk should provide some more general food for thought around
    the agile development methodologies used by many application
    developers today versus the methodologies used by open-source
    projects today.

    OpenStack continues to grow exponentially as the de facto standard
    for open source Cloud platforms. But how can someone quickly get
    started with learning this exciting new technology? This
    workshop will walk participants through an overview of the
    OpenStack components and offer practical suggestions and
    resources for learning OpenStack. To demonstrate one way to get
    started, we will assist workshop attendees to set up a
    multi-node OpenStack cloud, on their laptops, using Red Hat's
    RDO and the
    Packstack utility.

    Participants will be introduced to a range of cloud
    functionality including those that were added to the Icehouse
    release. During the workshop, participants will have the
    opportunity to the following:
    - Installing OpenStack on their laptops
    - Walking through the Horizon dashboard
    - Adding new users
    - Adding an image to Glance
    - Defining networks in Neutron
    - Starting a new virtual server
    - Creating and attaching Cinder storage volumes to virtual servers
    - Storing objects in Swift Using the Horizon Dashboard user interface
    - Exploring Ceilometer metrics
    - Instructions to prepare for the workshop can be found at http://openstack.redhat.com/GettingStartedIcehouse_w_GRE

- title: Customizing Horizon without breaking on upgrades
  speaker: Matthias Runge
  start: 2014-05-12 16:40
  end: 2014-05-12 15:20
  description: |
    In probably most cases, when Horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard is
    installed, it's desired to change it's look and feel to meet the
    corporate look and feel.
    In many installations, software is deployed via software packages.
    When updating or upgrading software via distribution packages, in
    almost all cases changes applied to files installed will become
    overwritten. In this session, we'll show, how to achieve both,
    changes and not to break due package updates or even upgrades.

    During Icecouse development cycle, a the plugin architecture
    blueprint was implemented; this session will show, how to create or
    modify a look and feel along distribution provided packages that
    will not break on minor package updates or version upgrades.

  start: 2014-05-12 14:50
  end: 2014-05-12 15:30
  description: |
    OpenDaylight is an open platform for network programmability to
    enable SDN and create a solid foundation for NFV for networks at any
    size and scale. OpenDaylight is licensed under the Eclipse Public
    License, and recently had its first release, code-named Hydrogen.
    The OpenDaylight and OpenStack Neutron teams have collaborated to
    integrate the two projects such that OpenDaylight can provide
    virtual tenant networking for OpenStack tenants. This talk will show
    you how to use OpenDaylight with OpenStack, including setup and
    debug of the environment. We will walk through technical details of
    the implementation and show examples of the benefits of using
    OpenDaylight to scale virtual tenant networks with OpenStack
    Neutron. Additionallly, we will cover future directions of
    OpenDaylight integration with OpenStack Neutron. Attendees will
    leave this session with a clear understanding of how OpenDaylight
    integrates with OpenStack Neutron to provide virtual networks for
    OpenStack tenants.

  description: |
    In large deployments, some piece of Nova is deployed almost
    everywhere.
    Until recently, the story for how you upgrade to using a newer
    version of this fast-paced project has been turn off the cloud" --
    an unacceptable answer for something that aims to be deployed at a
    scale large enough to make such a plan unfeasible. Over the last
    several releases, "upgrade-ability" has been a major theme of
    development for the Nova team, shooting for both reduced downtime of
    core components and elimination of the need to "turn off the cloud"
    while thousands of nodes are upgraded atomically.
    This talk will cover the incremental steps we have made in
    recent cycles, as well as reveal the major new capability that
    the Icehouse release brings to the table.
