# Red Hat Events

This is the data for Red Hat's event website at:
http://community.redhat.com/events/

The information in this repository is intended to cover Red Hat presence
at conferences, tradeshows, and other events â€” ranging from Red Hat 
employees giving talks at a conference to a Red Hat specific event 
(sponsored event, Internet hangout, IRC session, etc.) to simply having
a booth or even people representing Red Hat at an event in some manner.
