## Aeolus: Deploying Across Clouds the Open Source Way
### Time: September 29, 2012 15:00 - 15:50 EDT



Aeolus is a next-generation cloud computing API allowing system administrators to deploy, monitor, and manipulate instances running on any number of cloud providers in a consistent manner. Using the free and open toolset end users are able to access and manage cloud resources without having to worry about vendor lockin and/or changes in cloud provider terms of service and pricing.  In this session we will demonstrate how to use the Aeolus utilities to deploy instances to various cloud providers, monitor running services, and take and migrate snapshots of Linux systems across disparate providers.

## Highly Available Applications
### Time: September 29, 2012 17:00 - 17:50 EDT



This talk will describe what he considers the "holy grail of availability" - running highly available applications inside of highly available virtual machines.  This is what most customers have asked for, and now we have the technology to accomplish this goal. It will outline the requirements, best practices, and experiences of trying to accomplish this once daunting task.  Technology will concentrate on ovirt.org/KVM and Pacemaker - but will also touch on Red Hat Cluster Suite, RHEV/KVM, and VMWare.
