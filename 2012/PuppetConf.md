## Package management and Puppet
### Name: Sam Kottler
### Time: September 28, 2012 10:45 - 11:30 PST

This talk will cover the topic of managing packages across several environments and staging. We'll cover topics including the package resources included in Puppet core, how to hack on the Yum and Deb providers, and how to extend Puppet via custom resources and basic principals of idempotent operations. Some knowledge of the package management and Puppet resources is ideal for users attending the talk. We'll build on that knowledge and move into more advanced topics like custom providers and resources.
