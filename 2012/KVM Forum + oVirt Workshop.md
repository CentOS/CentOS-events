# KVM Forum + oVirt Workshop
## Location: Barcelona, Spain
## Date: November 7-9, 2012





KVM is an industry leading open source hypervisor that provides an ideal platform for datacenter virtualization, virtual desktop infrastructure, and cloud computing. Once again, it's time to bring together the community of developers and users that define the KVM ecosystem for our annual technical conference. We will discuss the current state of affairs and plan for the future of KVM, its surrounding infrastructure, and management tools. So mark your calendar and join us in advancing KVM.

We are excited to announce that the oVirt Workshop will be held in conjunction with KVM Forum this year. The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project for anyone who cares about Linux-based KVM virtualization. Providing a feature-rich server virtualization management system with advanced capabilities for hosts and guests, including high availability, live migration, storage management, system scheduler, and more. By open we mean open source & open governance, done right.

During this workshop you’ll learn about the technical background and direction of the oVirt project. You’ll meet the developers, and have an opportunity to see and dive into the code right away. The workshop is open to all who want to use, get involved with, or  learn about the comprehensive open virtualization management platform, oVirt. The sessions cover the technical projects details, governance, getting involved, usage, and much more. If you have any interest in an Open Virtualization Management platform, this workshop is for you!

## oVirt Node Architecture Design and Roadmpa
### Name: Mike Burns
### Time: November 7, 2012 11:15 - 12:00 CEST

This talk will dive into the architecture and design of oVirt Node with discussions of it’s major features. We’ll look at the different aspects of the image including deployment methods, extensibility, and advantages and disadvantages of this packaging model. We’ll also explore some of the major recent additions, like plugin support and Stateless operation, as well as some of the features that are on our current roadmap.

This talk is primarily an overview. It's geared toward people looking to deploy, use, or extend ovirt-node.

## KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V Enlightenments
### Name: Vadim Rozenfeld
### Time: November 7, 2012 13:00 - 13:40 CEST

Enlightenments are enhancements made to the operating system to help reduce the cost of certain operating system functions. Presently, all recent Microsoft OSes support Hyper-V enlightened I/O and hypervisor aware kernels. Number of Hyper-V Enlightenments, like virtual APIC, spinlocks and invariant TSC can be implemented in KVM.

This presentation should be interesting to a wide audience, but mostly targeted to developers.

## QOM Vadis? Taking Objects to CPU and Beyond
### Name: Andreas Färber
### Time: November 7, 2012 13:00 - 13:40 CEST

Anthony Liguori has contributed the QEMU Object Model (QOM) as new infrastructure for device modeling and inspection at the beginning of this year. Highlight some of the changes for device authors this requires and provide an outlook of what new possibilities this offers over former qdev. Focus of this talk will be my ongoing CPU remodeling - vision, achievements for v1.1 and v1.2, next goals.

I assume that Anthony will say some words about QOM in his key note. This presentation will not cover the why/how but rather the how-to and where-to for device authors in the status quo as well as some DOs and DON'Ts concerning CPU*State for all contributors. Depending on upstream progress this talk might also cover a brief overview of differences between softmmu and linux-user wrt CPU. I don't plan to go into x86 CPU hotplug details, that could well be covered by Igor/Eduardo in a separate talk.
