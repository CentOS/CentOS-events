## Write your first Ceylon program with the language authors
### Name: Stephane Epardaud and Gavin King
### Time: November 12, 2012 13:30 - 16:30 CET

During this session, Gavin King (author of Ceylon) and Stéphane Épardaud (Ceylon team) will help you learn the Ceylon programming language, hand in hand, from downloading the tools, using the IDE, getting to know the various tools, the language SDK, all the way to running your own module repository and publishing your first Ceylon modules to it and to the official Ceylon module repository.

No knowledge of Ceylon required, though the audience should be familiar with the Java programming language.

## Raise Your Java EE 6 Productivity Bar with JBoss Forge
### Name: Koen Aers
### Time: November 12, 2012 18:05 - 18:35 CET

Getting started with Java EE development can, despite the important improvements over time, still be quite daunting for newbies. Putting a JSF application to work, setting up persistence or enabling restful web services are not trivial tasks. 

JBoss Forge is a versatile and lean development environment entirely written in Java and making smart use of CDI. Its purpose is to offer you the possibility of incrementally working in new functionality into existing Java projects. It is a command-line oriented tool, so creating entities or scaffolding a user interface is just a matter of issuing a few commands.

But what if your task cannot be done by Forge? No worries, as Forge operates by means of plug-ins, the answer is simply to look for an appropriate plugin or create it yourself if one is not available.

Finally, Forge can also be integrated in graphical IDE's opening up all its power to users of common platforms such as Eclipse.
Come to this session if you want to see this powerful tool live in action!

## Measuring performance and capacity planning in Java-based data grids
### Name: Mircea Markus
### Time: November 13, 2012 18:05 - 18:35 CET
### Room: 9

Measuring your data grid's performance it's not a trivial task. In this presentation, Mircea Markus will introduce project Radargun: a benchmarking framework that helps measuring the performance and throughput of in-memory data grids. Radargun offers an simple and effective way to compare how various data grid products would behave based on a specific use case helping you to chose the one that fits your need. It also makes it a great tool setting up a prototyping your data-grid based application in a matter of minutes.

## Maven dependency puzzlers
### Name: Geoffrey de Smet
### Time: November 13, 2012 17:25 - 17:55 CET

We release our dependency information as pom.xml files on a maven repository. But how well do we understand the effect of these pom.xml files on our users? What problems do we create in ours and their dependency resolution?

In this session, you’ll be presented with several Maven puzzlers. Each Maven puzzler is a small POM configuration with a multiple-choice question about the output. Some puzzlers are easy, others are hard. Whoever answers most puzzlers correctly, wins.

## Bean Validation 1.1: it's not Beansland anymore
### Name: Emmanuel Bernard
### Time: November 15, 2012 10:50 - 11:50 CET

Bean Validation standardizes constraint declarations and validation for the Java platform.Bean Validation 1.0 has been widely adopted and seamlessly integrated with some other JSRs (like JSF, JPA) and the rich Java framework environment at large.

We will explore what version 1.1 brings to the table and what new features you can expect for your future Java SE or EE applications. We will discuss in an example driven fashion method-level validation, Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) integration and many more new features and improvements.

Come join us to see that Bean Validation is not Beansland anymore.

## The JBoss Polyglot Revolution - Be part of it!
### Name: Galder Zamarreño
### Time: November 15, 2012 10:50 - 11:50 CET

In this talk, Galder will look at the evolution of JBoss, from a producer of java based middleware, to the current expansion towards multi-language platforms. How did Torquebox come about? Why are we creating Ceylon? What is Escalante? What is Immutant? This and many other questions will be answered in this informal chat that will not only look into the motivations behind building middleware in other languages, but will also discuss the technological advances that have this expansion possible. During this presentation the audience will get invaluable feedback on the lessons learnt while developing with other languages, pitfalls of the different languages used, tips of learning new languages...etc, giving them first-hand advice that they will be able to apply in their work environments. Finally, the talk will finish with information on how join and contribute to the JBoss Polyglot Revolution!

## Practical guide to Infinispan Queries
### Name: Sanne Grinovero
### Time: November 15, 2012 13:10 - 13:25 CET

Infinispan is a powerful and extremely efficient transactional NoSQL: a distributed in-memory Data Grid exposing primarily a Map-like API, but also integrating Apache Lucene to allow full-text queries. This integration however can be setup in a number of ways, resulting in different architectures.

How to pick the right clustering mode? Which indexing backend to choose? Should you use a shared CacheLoader?

Let’s explore these options via some practical examples.

## From Zero to JavaEE in 15 Minutes (or Less)
### Name: Koen Aers
### Time: November 15, 2012 13:10 - 13:25 CET

What if somebody told you that you have to reverse engineer a database and to create a JSF application with CRUD operations for it? What if he adds that he needs this application deployed in the cloud and that moreover you only have 15 minutes to achieve this? Wouldn't you think this person is out of his mind? During this quickie we will show you how to do this using JBoss Forge.
