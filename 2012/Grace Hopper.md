## First Experiences in Open Source Software: How to get involved
### Name: Leslie Hawthorn
### Time: October 5, 2012 11:30 - 12:30 EST

This panel will provide people with four different perspectives on getting started in open source projects. Panelists represent a range of industry and academic backgrounds, a diversity of contribution types, and a variety of projects of all sizes, ages, and types. We’ll relate our own “what we wish we’d known” beginner stories in the hopes of inspiring others to start on the road to becoming open source contributors.
