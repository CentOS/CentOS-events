# Gluster Workshop
## Location: Barcelona, Spain
## Date: November 8, 2012

GlusterFS is a community produced, open source, distributed file system capable of scaling to several petabytes(actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands of clients. The morning workshop sessions will provide attendees with a broad and deep overview of GlusterFS, from history and roadmap to the latest release, v 3.3. The afternoon sessionswill focus on Gluster implementation as a big data solution, development platform and tool for systems administrators.


## The State of the Gluster Community
### Name: John Mark Walker
### Time: November 8, 2012 9:00 - 10:00 CEST

Now one year after the Red Hat acquisition of Gluster, Inc, the Gluster community is growing up. Every day, more users and developers come to appreciate the simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility of distributed data storage, GlusterFS style. In this talk, attendees will learn about the project's history, the most recent release, the in-process developer sprint, and what new features are just around the corner.

## Integrating GlusterFS, oVirt and KVM
### Name: Vijay Bellur
### Time: November 8, 2012 11:15 - 12:15 CEST

GlusterFS is a distributed file system that can scale to several PetaBytes. oVirt is a management platform for Kernel based Virtual Machine (KVM) and can be used to manage GlusterFS as well.

This presentation will discuss integration of KVM and GlusterFS through various mechanisms like: 

<ul>
<li>GlusterFS's FUSE based native protocol</li>
<li>Qemu and libglusterfsclient </li>
</ul>

Details on how both file and block based interfaces can be presented to  host KVM images from GlusterFS will be provided. 

The presentation will then talk about how oVirt can be used to provision GlusterFS volumes and how such volumes can then be used for hosting KVM  images. Configuration details of both these features from oVirt would be  presented.

The benefits emerging from integration of these projects would be highlighted as well.

## GlusterFS Demos: Getting Started in a Flash, UFO, & Wireshark
### Name: Eco Willson and Niels de Vos
### Time: November 8, 2012 14:15 - 15:15 CEST

Gluster's Unified File and Object (UFO) is a hybrid solution that allows you to access your existing data simultaneously via traditional filesystems and via the SWIFT API's.    In this talk, we will go over the benefits of using UFO, as well as demonstrating common use cases for setting up object storage with Gluster.

## GlusterFS for SysAdmins
### Name: Dustin Black
### Time: November 8, 2012 15:30 - 16:30 CEST

GlusterFS represents a dramatic departure  from traditional backend storage solutions. In this talk, attendees will  get a technical dive into GlusterFS from the SysAdmin perspective,  including a study of implementation scenarios. We'll explore such topics  as enterprise storage strategy, data access methods, the elegant  simplicity of scaling both out and up, the strength of redundancy and  fault tolerance, and ways to boost performance.
