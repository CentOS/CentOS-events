# LinuxCon North America
## Location: New Orleans, Louisiana, USA
## Date: September 16 - 18, 2013

LinuxCon is the Linux Foundation's North American Linux conference,
covering all topics Linux-related.

Rich Bowen will be at LinuxCon NA, at the OpenStack booth, representing
the OpenStack and the RDO team.

## Everything I Know About the Cloud, I Learned From Game of Thrones
### Name: Joe Brockmeier
### Time: September 18, 2013 14:00 EST

George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series, and the HBO
television series, makes for great entertainment — if a little bloody and
short on happy endings. Though the “Game of Thrones” characters inhabit
a universe that hasn’t even seen gunpowder yet, a lot of the lessons
learned in GoT also apply to building, deploying, and maintaining an
IaaS cloud. This talk will take a humorous approach, but also give
attendees some crucial insights into moving from traditional IT to cloud
computing.


## It Was Never About Innovation
### Name: John Mark Walker
### Time: September 16, 2013 10:35 EST

Cloud computing as an industry phenomenon is built almost entirely on
open source pieces, but ironically (or perhaps, perversely) is used to
create proprietary services. This talk shows how the four software
freedoms achieved a more level playing field for software users and
developers and provided a solid foundation on which innovation
flourished. Innovation was an interesting by-product, not something
pursued. Unfortunately, the four software freedoms are not enough to
compel open cloud services. The lessons learned from open source should
be used to achieve a level playing field in cloud computing.

## OpenStack Performance & Scale
### Name: Mark Wagner
### Time: September 16, 2013 11:35 EST

Review performance and scale testing of OpenStack by the Red Hat
Performance team. This will include management platform performance and
individual node performance. Also discuss the tools, methodologies, and
strategies used in the testing. Using test data from the Performance
Lab, Mark will demonstrate tunings that improve performance and show
where these tunings will be applied to improve out-of-the-box
performance. He will also reveal tips and tricks for achieving higher
density.

## Resource Management with Systemd
### Name: Lennart Poettering
### Time: September 16, 2013 15:10 EST

Resource management is highly relevant on both large servers (where many
resources need to be distributed among an even higher number of
consumers to get the maximum out of the invested infrastructure) and on
small embedded devices (where few resources need to be distributed among
many consumers). Newer systemd versions support resource management
out-of-the-box, as first-class functionality of service management. In
this talk we will show you how to make use of it. We will tell you how
to dynamically assign resource limits to running services and virtual
machines and how to reliably determine the current resource usage of
your services and virtual machines. We will introduce you to new
concepts such as "Slices" which you can use to create arbitrary resource
partition hierarchies. And we will give you a bit of background on what
actually happens on the lower level.

## Using OpenStack Heat Autoscaling
### Name: Steven Dake
### Time: September 16, 2013 16:10 EST

OpenStack Heat provides autoscaling functionality for dynamically
growing and shrinking compute power to meet the needs of a scale-out web
application. In this speaking session, a brief introduction to Heat is
provided, an autoscaling implementation lifecycle is recommended, and
some brief thoughts on future OpenStack Heat autoscaling direction are
explained.

## Per-CPU Facilities in the Linux Kernel
### Name: Tejun Heo
### Time: September 16, 2013 16:10 EST

With even small devices having multi-core processors and NUMA
configuration being the norm in the server space, reducing cross-CPU
traffic is one of the major optimization points, and per-cpu data
structures are very effective and well-established way to achieve it.
The Linux kernel has extensive per-cpu facilities which are still
evolving. This presentation looks briefly at the evolution of per-cpu
facilities in the kernel and goes through several examples of per-cpu
constructs and their usages.

## Navigating the LEgal Minefields of Fedora
### Name: Tom Callaway
### Time: September 16, 2013 17:10 EST

Fedora has a commitment to Free Software at its core, but the universe
is not so simple. Backed by Red Hat, Fedora presents a significant
target for legal threats and has to be ever vigilant to minimize risk
while still providing the latest and greatest in functionality. In this
talk, I will discuss some of the framework that Fedora has
established to navigate the legal minefields present in our
industry, including:

* Copyright Licensing
* Software Patents
* Trademarks
* Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

## Enterprise Identity Management with Open Source Tools
### Name Dmitri Pal
### Time: Semtember 16, 2013 17:10 EST

The talk will cover the FreeIPA and partially SSSD projects introducing
FreeIPA as the first fully functional open source centralized
authentication and identity management solution comparable to Active
Directory in its capabilities but focusing primarily on the identity
management needs of the Linux and UNIX client systems.
