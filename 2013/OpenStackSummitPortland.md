Charles Babbage's Difference Engine amazed Ada Lovelace with its unprecedented engineering feats just like OpenStack amazes people today. We have some stories to share about learning, exploring new territory and making new connections. This story is about newcomers working on OpenStack as interns. Three were in the GNOME Outreach Program for Women from January to March. One has been an intern twice at two different OpenStack companies.

For the Outreach Program for Women, three mentors worked with interns; one from the Image service (glance) project, one from the Dashboard (horizon) project, and one from the documentation project. For the company internships, mentors at the company worked with the intern. We want to share their stories so you can learn about our current OpenStack internships and future plans for such programs. We will talk about what they worked on while interning, what struggles they faced while learning everything about OpenStack, and where they want to go from here. We can provide metrics that show the impact of involving women in Open Source, and metrics about the impact these interns have on the projects. We want to describe the future vision for internship programs based on the lessons learned recently.

If you are an organization looking to hire OpenStack interns, or a potential intern seeking an internship, this session is for you.
