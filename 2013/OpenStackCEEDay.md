## RDO: From zero to OpenStack in 20 minutes

RDO is a community supported distribution of the latest releases of OpenStack for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and its clones like CentOS and Scientific Linux. We also distribute
packages of the latest release of OpenStack for Fedora. Through a Red Hat developed tool
called PackStack, we have made the installation and configuration process quick and easy.
You can go from a bare operating system to a running instance in as little as 15 to 20
minutes.

Come and hear about this distribution, and about Red Hat's work in the OpenStack project.
