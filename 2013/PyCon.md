# PyCon 2013
## Location: Santa Clara, California, US
## Date: March 13-21, 2013

We're still waiting on the results of the Call for Papers, but several Red Hat employees hope to give talks at PyCon 2013. We'll also have folks participating in the sprints following the conference. We'll have more updates, but in the interim check out the conference website at <https://us.pycon.org/2013/>

You can plan visit us in the Red Hat booth on the show floor (#132) to hear more about Fedora, OpenShift and how Red Hat uses Python.
